First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

Lock the dependencies and install them by using command:

```bash
crewai install
```

### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash

This command initializes the project_coversational_expert Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.
